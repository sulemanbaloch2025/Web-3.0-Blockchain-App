# Web-3.0-Blockchain-App-


This is a project that I designed for my independent study : Web Development 

In this project, I :
- Connected a regular React.js application to the blockchain and paired it to your Ethereum wallet using MetaMask
- Learned how to write Smart Contracts on the Ethereum network using the #Solidity programming language
- Created a full-fledged Web 3.0 application that allows users to send transactions through the blockchain
